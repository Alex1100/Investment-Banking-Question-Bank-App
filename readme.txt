Simple app created with Ionic. To use, make sure you have ionic installed. Then clone this repo and type "ionic serve" if you would like to access the web version. To obtain the app version, type "ionic run android" or "ionic run ios" if you have an apple developer account. May or may not post this app to App stores in the future! Good luck with your Investment Banking interviews :)


P.S. Feel free to contribute to this project with any good IB interview questions, behavioural or technical.
