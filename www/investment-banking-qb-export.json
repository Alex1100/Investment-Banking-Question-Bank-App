If no further direction is provided, then you would say you'd think about some type of niche business with high margins that requires little startup capital ($1 million is not a lot) and ongoing maintenance - those make it harder to turn a profit and sell that business one day. This is one reason why some PE investors focus on software companies. It's better to focus on a niche market because most broad, horizontal markets are already dominated by major companies. Explain your reasoning on why this type of business would be attractive and how it could grow with minimal future investment.",

Instead, go more obscure and pick a company no one knows so that they can tell you've done your research so that they're less likely to ask probing questions. You don't necessarily need to give financial details, but if the company is public you can easily find the information. When you talk, make the firm attractive and emphasize qualities that investors would find appealing, such as a well-diversified customer base, a unique competitive advantage in the market or a high-margin business model.",

      "answer" : "To assess whether it is viable or not, you must determine whether you can make a profit. For a laundry machine operation, you'd start by looking at the location, estimate how many customers you could get, how frequently they do laundry and how much they pay each time to do their laundry. These figures give you an idea of monthly/annual revenue. On the expenses side, biggest cost would be the upfront construction and/or purchase of the build and machines. You would probably need a loan for this. Then take into account the cost of maintaing and servicing the machines, building maintenance and employee wages. Location is the biggest role in the success of this type of business. If this company was next to an apartment complex where everyone has laundry machines, you're doomed from the beginning.",

    "8" : {
      "answer" : "Similar to talking about a company you admire. One key difference is that you need to mention specific financial figures. Since the company is public, it shouldn't be too hard to find. Look at Revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples and saying whether it is higher or lower than competitors is a step in the right direction. Struture: 1) Give the name and summarize what they do 2) Brief overview of its financials 3) State how it is undervalued or more attractive than rivals due to competitive advantages 4) Say how there is a long-term trend in its favor 5) Talk about how good the next 5-10 years will be for the company.",

      "answer" : "Banks made mortgage loans to people who were in no position to pay them off or even meet monthly payments. Borrowing was easy because interest rates were at historical lows. At the same time, these mortgage loans were combined and packaged into securities that banks traded, acquired and sold to investors. A typical package might contain mortgages given to credible borrowers as well as risky borrowers, more risky ones were labelled as subprime. The thinking was that even if one defaulted, the rest still had value. As unqualified borrowers defaulted, buyers disappeared overnight and the value of these assets plummeted to $0. As a result, the value of many of these banks approached $0 and went bankrupt - all because these securities were so complex nobody understood their real value and the risks involved.",

    },
    "2" : {
      "answer" : "You want to understand the bigger picture and how and why large companies make decisions rather than just working with individual investors.

    },
    "3" : {

    "4" : {
      "answer" : "Reverse of question 3, you can apply a similar strategy and say how you hold a long-term view and haven't just become interested overnight. Being able to point out specific evidence to back up your interest - your own portfolio, the finance/business clubs you're in, or even day trading - also helps.",

You've been interested all along and now you realize you reall ywant to do it after exploring other alternatives and not liked them. If this is a small company to a big company (or vice versa) you can also say something about that, using the standard reasons we went through before - small means more responsibility and client interaction , and big means working on more major deals and learning more technical skills.",
      "question" : "Question 6: If you enjoyed your last internship and got an offer to come back, why are you trying to switch into investment banking now?"
    },
    "7" : {
      "answer" : "This is the key question asked of many career changers and anyone else at the VP-level (or above) at a company who is looking to switch into banking as an Associate. Here are the main points to emphasize: 1) You've done your homework and spoken with a lot of people about this move - and you like the finance work you've done before 2) Banking is faster-paced and appeals to you more because you make more of an impact 3) You're fine with the pay cut and additional hours because of the improved opportunities to make an impact and advance.",

In that case, you should just briefly acknowledge it then move to a different topic.

If you’ve had some other type of gap because of school, economic hardship, or something similar, you need to find the strength in whatever weakness you had – this is really just a disguised 'weakness' question. 'The truth is, my family went through some financial hardships back then and I was forced to take a leave of absence from school for awhile, and spend most of my time working to help them pay the bills. Initially I was pretty upset, but I learned a lot about time management, work ethic, and how to juggle 5 different major responsibilities at once.

It's similar to sell-side and buy-side M&A - in one you're advising the company who's trying to sell or get out of the mess they are in and in the other you are advising buyers and lenders that are trying to take what they can from the company. Note that 'creditors' are often multiple parties since it's anyone who's loaned the company money. You need to research which bank does what, but typically Blackstone and Lazard advise the debtor and Hokey advises the creditor (these 3 are commonly known as the top 3 in the field).",

      "answer" : "You gain a very specialized skill set (and therefore become more valuable/employable) and much of the work is actually more technical/interesting than M&A, for example. You are get more exposure because you get to see both the bright sides and the not-so-bright sides of companies. If you're coming in with any legal background or have aspirations of doing that in the future, there's a ton of overlap with Restructuring because you have to operate within a legal framework and attorneys are involved at every step of the process - so that can be one of your selling points as well.",

      "answer" : "More so than M&A and IPO processes, Restructuring/Distressed M&A requires extremely specialized knowledge and relationships. There are only a few banks with good practices, and they are selected on the basis of their experience during similar deals in the industry as well as their relationships with all the other parties that will be involved in the deal process. Remember that a Restructuring involves many more parties than a normal M&A or financing deals does - there are lawyers, shareholders, debt investors, suppliers, directors, management, and crisis managers, and managing everyone can be like herding cats. Lawyers can also be a major source of business, since they're heavily involved with any sort of Restructuring/Distress scenario.",

      "answer" : "It is money borrowed by the distressed company that has repayment priority over all other existing secured/unsecured debt, equity, and other claims, and is considered 'safe' by lenders because it is subject to stricter terms than other forms of financing. Theoretically, this makes it easier for distressed companies to emerge from the bankruptcy prcoess - though some argue that DIP financing is actually harmful on an empirical basis. Some DIP lending firms are known for trying to take over companies at a significant discount due to the huge amount of collateral they have. One reason companies might choose to file for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy is to gain access to DIP financing.",

Companies typically use asset purchases for divestitures, distressed M&A, and smaller private companies; anything large, public and healthy generally needs to be acquired through a stock purchase. A buyer almost always prefers an asset purchase so it can avoid assumption of unknown liabilities (there are also tax advantages for the buyer).

Specifically, 'owed expense' line items like Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses are often much higher than they would be for a healthy company, so you need to subtract the difference if you're assuming the current liabilities.

You might be tempted to say something like, 'SE falls!' but the share price of the company does not affect shareholder's equity, which is a book value. What actually happens: as a result of the share price drop, customers, vendors, suppliers and lendors would be more reluctant to do business with the distressed company - so its revenue might fall and its Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses might climb to unhealthy levels. All of that might cause the company to fail or require more capital, but the share price decline itself does not lead to bankruptcy.

    },
    "14" : {
      "answer" : "This gets confusing because of the different units involved. First, note that these convertible bonds are 'in-the-money' because the company's share price is $100 but the conversion price is $50. So we count them as additional shares rather than debt. Next, we need to divide the value of the convertible bonds - $10 million - by teh par value - $1000 - to figure out how many individual bonds we get ($10 million / $1000 = 1,0000 convertible bonds). Next, we need to figure out how many shares this number represents. The number of shares per bond is the par value divided by the conversion price ($1,000 / $50 = 20 shares per bond). So we have 200,000 new shares (10,000 * 20) created by the convertibles, giving us 1.2 million diluted shares outstanding. WE DO NOT USE THE TREASURY METHOD WITH CONVERTIBLES because the company is not 'receiving' any cash from us.",

    },
    "15" : {
      "answer" : "Equity value is the MARKET VALUE and SE is the BOOK VALUE. Equity value can never be negative because shares outstanding and share prices can never be negative, whereas SE could be any value. For healthy companies, Equity Value usually far exceeds Shareholder's Equity.",

Technology and Energy should be straightforward -you're looking at traffic and energy reserves as value drivers rather than revenue or profit. For Retail/Airlines, you often remove Rent because it is a major expense and one that varies significantly between different types of companies. For REITs, FFO is a common metric that adds back Depreciation and subtracts gains on the sale of property. Depreciation is a non-cash yet extremely large expense in real estate, and gains on sales of properties aare assumed to be non-recurring, as FFO is viewed as a 'normalized' picture of the cash flow the REIT is generating.",

      "answer" : "Technically it could go either way, but in most cases the LBO will give you a lower valuation. Here's the easiest way to think about it: with an LBO, you do not get any value from the cash flows of a company in between Year 1 and the final year - you're only valuing it based on its terminal value. With a DCF, by contrast, you're taking into accoun BOTH the company's cash flows in between and its terminal value, so values tend to be higher. Note: Unlike a DCF, an LBO model by itself does not give a specific valuation. Instead, you set a desired IRR and determine how much you would pay for the company (the valuation) based on that.",
