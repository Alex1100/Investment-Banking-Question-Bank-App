'they're shifting to the web because it's cheaper and lower maintenance for them' 3) they don't explain the impact on the market as a whole ex. 'such companies are growing very quickly while more traditional companies are either struggling or shifting to that model'",

If no further direction is provided, then you would say you'd think about some type of niche business with high margins that requires little startup capital ($1 million is not a lot) and ongoing maintenance - those make it harder to turn a profit and sell that business one day. This is one reason why some PE investors focus on software companies. It's better to focus on a niche market because most broad, horizontal markets are already dominated by major companies. Explain your reasoning on why this type of business would be attractive and how it could grow with minimal future investment.",

      "answer" : "Do not say something commonly known like Google or Apple. Instead, go more obscure and pick a company no one knows so that they can tell you've done your research so that they're less likely to ask probing questions. You don't necessarily need to give financial details, but if the company is public you can easily find the information. When you talk, make the firm attractive and emphasize qualities that investors would find appealing, such as a well-diversified customer base, a unique competitive advantage in the market or a high-margin business model.",

    "6" : {
      "answer" : "To assess whether it is viable or not, you must determine whether you can make a profit. For a laundry machine operation, you'd start by looking at the location, estimate how many customers you could get, how frequently they do laundry and how much they pay each time to do their laundry. These figures give you an idea of monthly/annual revenue. On the expenses side, biggest cost would be the upfront construction and/or purchase of the build and machines. You would probably need a loan for this. Then take into account the cost of maintaing and servicing the machines, building maintenance and employee wages. Location is the biggest role in the success of this type of business. If this company was next to an apartment complex where everyone has laundry machines, you're doomed from the beginning.",

      "question" : "Question 7: Tell me about an M&A deal that interested you recently."
    },
    "8" : {
      "answer" : "Similar to talking about a company you admire. One key difference is that you need to mention specific financial figures. Since the company is public, it shouldn't be too hard to find. Look at Revenue, EBITDA and P/E multiples and saying whether it is higher or lower than competitors is a step in the right direction. Struture: 1) Give the name and summarize what they do 2) Brief overview of its financials 3) State how it is undervalued or more attractive than rivals due to competitive advantages 4) Say how there is a long-term trend in its favor 5) Talk about how good the next 5-10 years will be for the company.",

    "9" : {
      "answer" : "Banks made mortgage loans to people who were in no position to pay them off or even meet monthly payments. Borrowing was easy because interest rates were at historical lows. At the same time, these mortgage loans were combined and packaged into securities that banks traded, acquired and sold to investors. A typical package might contain mortgages given to credible borrowers as well as risky borrowers, more risky ones were labelled as subprime. The thinking was that even if one defaulted, the rest still had value. As unqualified borrowers defaulted, buyers disappeared overnight and the value of these assets plummeted to $0. As a result, the value of many of these banks approached $0 and went bankrupt - all because these securities were so complex nobody understood their real value and the risks involved.",

    "10" : {
      "answer" : "Give an answer and back it up with solid reasoning.

Discuss how you've worked long hours/in teams/paid attention to details before and succeeded at whatever you've done before. You can also point out that although someone might have had a banking internship, that doesn't mean he/she did well in it - and that you may be better equipped with your experiences.",

    },
    "2" : {
      "answer" : "You want to understand the bigger picture and how and why large companies make decisions rather than just working with individual investors.

    },
    "3" : {
      "answer" : "Talk about your long-term view and how a downturn could be an even better time to enter the industry because you'll know how to work when times are both good and bad. In addition, you've been interested in finance for a long time and that you're not going to let short-term difficulties deter you from entering the field - you've explored other options and concluded that this is the best one for you.",
      "question" : "Question 3: You’re a smart guy/girl with a lot of options, and right now the economy is not doing well and lots of banks have failed. Why are you still interested in banking when you could do anything else?"
    },
    "4" : {
      "answer" : "Reverse of question 3, you can apply a similar strategy and say how you hold a long-term view and haven't just become interested overnight. Being able to point out specific evidence to back up your interest - your own portfolio, the finance/business clubs you're in, or even day trading - also helps.",

      "answer" : "Almost anything could work here but make sure it's nothing too recent. Otherwise, it looks like you became interested on a whim.

    },
    "6" : {
      "answer" : "You're looking for something faster-paced where there's a better learning opportunity and more of a chance to make an impact. You've been interested all along and now you realize you reall ywant to do it after exploring other alternatives and not liked them. If this is a small company to a big company (or vice versa) you can also say something about that, using the standard reasons we went through before - small means more responsibility and client interaction , and big means working on more major deals and learning more technical skills.",
      "question" : "Question 6: If you enjoyed your last internship and got an offer to come back, why are you trying to switch into investment banking now?"
    },
    "7" : {
      "answer" : "This is the key question asked of many career changers and anyone else at the VP-level (or above) at a company who is looking to switch into banking as an Associate. Here are the main points to emphasize: 1) You've done your homework and spoken with a lot of people about this move - and you like the finance work you've done before 2) Banking is faster-paced and appeals to you more because you make more of an impact 3) You're fine with the pay cut and additional hours because of the improved opportunities to make an impact and advance.",

  "failure" : {
    "1" : {
      "answer" : "Do NOT give an actual fear (losing your friends, hating your life, getting laid off, working too much etc...).

In that case, you should just briefly acknowledge it then move to a different topic. It's bad if you make a mistake like that but it's worse if you embarrass your MD by pointing it out in broad daylight - chances are that no one will notice it anyways since pitch books are rarely read in meetings.",

If you’ve had some other type of gap because of school, economic hardship, or something similar, you need to find the strength in whatever weakness you had – this is really just a disguised 'weakness' question. 'The truth is, my family went through some financial hardships back then and I was forced to take a leave of absence from school for awhile, and spend most of my time working to help them pay the bills. Initially I was pretty upset, but I learned a lot about time management, work ethic, and how to juggle 5 different major responsibilities at once.

You probably want to say above 1.0, but not too much above it – you’re much more ambitious than the average person, which causes you to try lots of new things and achieve quite a bit, so that inevitably carries some risk.
